# B-Go Passenger Location Tracking Enhancement

## Overview

The B-Go app now includes enhanced passenger location tracking to improve the conductor-passenger coordination system. This enhancement allows conductors to see passenger locations in real-time, making it easier to coordinate pickups and provide better service.

## Key Features

### 1. Passenger Location Capture
- **Automatic Location Detection**: When passengers make a pre-booking, their current GPS location is automatically captured
- **Permission Handling**: Proper location permission requests with user-friendly error messages
- **Privacy-First**: Location is only captured when making a booking, not continuously tracked

### 2. Conductor Map Enhancements
- **Yellow Markers**: Show passenger current locations on conductor maps
- **Real-time Updates**: Passenger locations update as they move
- **Enhanced Legend**: Clear color coding for different marker types
- **Distance Calculations**: Automatic distance calculations between conductor and passengers

### 3. Improved Coordination
- **Better Pickup Planning**: Conductors can see where passengers are located
- **Route Optimization**: Conductors can plan optimal pickup routes
- **Reduced Wait Times**: More efficient passenger-conductor coordination

### Database Schema Updates:

#### Pre-Booking Document Structure:
```json
{
  "route": "Batangas",
  "direction": "SM Lipa to Batangas City",
  "from": "SM City Lipa",
  "to": "Batangas City",
  "fromLatitude": 13.9407,
  "fromLongitude": 121.1529,
  "toLatitude": 13.7563,
  "toLongitude": 121.0583,
  "passengerLatitude": 13.9407,  // NEW: Passenger's current location
  "passengerLongitude": 121.1529, // NEW: Passenger's current location
  "passengerLocationTimestamp": "timestamp", // NEW: When location was captured
  "fare": 25.0,
  "quantity": 2,
  "amount": 50.0,
  "fareTypes": ["Regular", "Student"],
  "status": "paid",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "userId": "user_uid"
}
```

#### User Document Updates:
```json
{
  "passengerLocation": {  // NEW: For continuous tracking
    "latitude": 13.9407,
    "longitude": 121.1529,
    "timestamp": "timestamp",
    "accuracy": 5.0
  },
  "lastLocationUpdate": "timestamp"
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### For Passengers:

1. **Location Permission**: App requests location permission when making pre-booking
2. **Automatic Capture**: Current location is captured when booking is confirmed
3. **Privacy Control**: Location is only shared when making bookings
4. **Optional Tracking**: Can enable continuous tracking for active bookings

### For Conductors:

1. **Enhanced Map View**: See passenger locations as yellow markers
2. **Real-time Updates**: Passenger locations update automatically
3. **Better Coordination**: Plan optimal pickup routes
4. **Distance Awareness**: Know how far passengers are from pickup points

## Marker Color System:

- **Blue**: Conductor's current location
- **Green**: Pick-up locations (route stops)
- **Red**: Drop-off locations (route stops)
- **Yellow**: Passenger current locations (NEW)

## Privacy & Security:

### Location Data Protection:
- Location is only captured when making bookings
- Data is stored securely in Firestore
- Users can disable location services
- No continuous tracking without consent

### Permission Handling:
- Graceful handling of denied permissions
- Clear error messages for location issues
- Fallback options when location unavailable

## Setup Instructions:

### 1. Dependencies:
Ensure `geolocator` package is included in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  geolocator: ^13.0.1
```

### 2. Android Permissions:
Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

### 3. iOS Permissions:
Add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs location access to help conductors find you for pickup.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs location access to help conductors find you for pickup.</string>
```

## Benefits:

### For Passengers:
- **Faster Pickups**: Conductors know exactly where you are
- **Better Service**: More accurate pickup times
- **Privacy Control**: Choose when to share location
- **Reduced Wait Times**: More efficient coordination

### For Conductors:
- **Better Planning**: See passenger locations on map
- **Route Optimization**: Plan efficient pickup routes
- **Reduced Confusion**: Clear visual indicators
- **Improved Service**: Better passenger experience

### For the System:
- **Efficiency**: Reduced pickup coordination time
- **Accuracy**: Real-time location data
- **Scalability**: Works with multiple passengers
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling

## Future Enhancements:

1. **Push Notifications**: Alert passengers when conductor is nearby
2. **ETA Calculations**: Show estimated arrival times
3. **Route Optimization**: AI-powered pickup route planning
4. **Emergency Features**: SOS location sharing
5. **Analytics**: Track pickup efficiency metrics

## Troubleshooting:

### Common Issues:

1. **Location Not Captured**:
   - Check GPS is enabled
   - Grant location permissions
   - Restart app if needed

2. **Markers Not Showing**:
   - Verify booking status is 'paid'
   - Check internet connection
   - Refresh conductor map

3. **Permission Denied**:
   - Go to device settings
