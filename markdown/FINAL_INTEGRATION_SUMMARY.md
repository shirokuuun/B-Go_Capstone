# Final PayMongo Integration Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We've Accomplished**

The Flutter app is now fully integrated with your **existing** admin website at [https://b-go-capstone-admin-chi.vercel.app/](https://b-go-capstone-admin-chi.vercel.app/) for PayMongo payments.

## ðŸ”„ **How It Works (No New JSX Files Needed)**

### Payment Flow

1. **User creates pre-booking** in Flutter app
2. **User clicks "Pay Now"** button
3. **Flutter app calls your admin website API** to create PayMongo checkout session
4. **Flutter app launches PayMongo checkout** directly in browser
5. **User completes payment** on PayMongo
6. **PayMongo sends webhook** to your admin website
7. **Flutter app polls your API** to check payment status
8. **Flutter app shows success** when payment is confirmed

### Key Benefits

âœ… **No new JSX files needed** - Uses your existing admin website
âœ… **Direct PayMongo integration** - Launches PayMongo checkout directly  
âœ… **Existing webhook handling** - Uses your current webhook setup
âœ… **Minimal changes required** - Only API endpoints need to exist
âœ… **Secure payment flow** - PayMongo handles all payment processing

## ðŸ“± **Flutter App Changes Made**

### 1. Dependencies Added

- `url_launcher: ^6.3.2` - For opening PayMongo checkout URLs
- `http: ^1.5.0` - For API communication

### 2. New Services Created

- `lib/services/payment_service.dart` - Handles payment operations
- `lib/services/webhook_service.dart` - Manages webhook processing

### 3. Updated Files

- `lib/pages/passenger/services/pre_book.dart` - Integrated with payment service
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added required dependencies

## ðŸ”§ **Your Admin Website Requirements**

You need to ensure these API endpoints exist in your admin website:

### 1. Create PayMongo Checkout Session

**File:** `api/payment/booking/create-paymongo-checkout.js`
**URL:** `/api/payment/booking/create-paymongo-checkout`
**Method:** POST

**What it does:**

- Creates PayMongo checkout session
- Updates booking with checkout session ID
- Returns checkout URL for Flutter app to launch

### 2. Check Payment Status

**File:** `api/payment/booking/[bookingId].js`
**URL:** `/api/payment/booking/[bookingId]?userId=user456`
**Method:** GET

**What it does:**

- Returns current payment status for a booking
- Used by Flutter app to poll payment status

### 3. PayMongo Webhook Handler

**File:** `api/webhooks/paymongo.js`
**URL:** `/api/webhooks/paymongo`
**Method:** POST

**What it does:**

- Receives PayMongo webhook notifications
- Updates booking status in Firestore
- Sends notifications to user

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Your Integration**

### 1. Test API Endpoints

Use the provided `test_admin_api.dart` file to test your API endpoints:

```dart
// Uncomment this line in test_admin_api.dart to run tests
void main() => AdminAPITester.runAllTests();
```

### 2. Test Flutter Integration

1. Create a pre-booking in Flutter app
2. Click "Pay Now" button
3. Verify PayMongo checkout opens
4. Complete test payment
5. Check payment status updates in app

### 3. Test PayMongo Webhooks

1. Configure webhook in PayMongo dashboard
2. Test webhook delivery
3. Verify booking status updates

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Checklist**

### Flutter App âœ…

- [x] Dependencies added
- [x] PaymentService created
- [x] WebhookService created
- [x] PreBook integration updated
- [x] Payment flow implemented
- [x] Error handling added
- [x] Status polling implemented

### Admin Website (Your Task)

- [ ] Ensure `create-paymongo-checkout.js` exists
- [ ] Ensure `[bookingId].js` exists
- [ ] Ensure `paymongo.js` webhook handler exists
- [ ] Configure PayMongo webhooks
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Deploy to production

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

### 1. Check Your Admin Website

Verify these files exist in your admin website:

```
api/
â”œâ”€â”€ payment/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ booking/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ create-paymongo-checkout.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [bookingId].js
â””â”€â”€ webhooks/
    â””â”€â”€ paymongo.js
```

### 2. Update API Endpoints (if needed)

If the endpoints don't exist, use the code from `ADMIN_WEBSITE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`.

### 3. Configure PayMongo

- Set up webhook endpoint: `https://b-go-capstone-admin-chi.vercel.app/api/webhooks/paymongo`
- Configure events: `payment.paid`, `payment.failed`

### 4. Test Integration

- Run the test script
- Test end-to-end payment flow
- Verify webhook processing

## ðŸ“š **Documentation Created**

1. **EXISTING_ADMIN_WEBSITE_INTEGRATION.md** - How to use your existing admin website
2. **ADMIN_WEBSITE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Complete API implementation guide
3. **test_admin_api.dart** - Test script for API endpoints
4. **FINAL_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - This summary

## ðŸŽ‰ **Ready to Use!**

The Flutter app is now ready to work with your existing admin website. When users click "Pay Now":

1. **App calls your API** â†’ Creates PayMongo checkout session
2. **App launches PayMongo** â†’ User completes payment
3. **PayMongo sends webhook** â†’ Your admin website updates booking
4. **App polls your API** â†’ Shows payment success

No new JSX files needed - just ensure your API endpoints exist and you're good to go! ðŸš€
